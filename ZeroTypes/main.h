 Implements "Zeroed" PODs and other lightweight data structure handlers
 for C++ making it more like Java or C# (somewhat, but faster)

 You can merge this code with your project and proceed from there.  
 
 See LinkedList.h for details on how to implement fast
 LinkedList common root classes using macros (or directly).

 Introducing the Philosophy of DRY+: "The ONE, the MANY, the DONE!"
