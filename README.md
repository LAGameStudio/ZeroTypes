__ZeroTypes Library__ is a personal helper library written for Visual C++ which performs rudimentary and important initialization of C-types (POD or plain-old data types) for Win32 and x64 systems.  It has been in development under the name ZeroTypes since 2007.  I wrote it to make my life easier.  It has, and now for the first time in 2017 it can make *your* life easier *too* -- AS SEEN ON https://zero.handmade.network/

I've been adding things to the informal predecessor of this library since 2006, but some of the functions harken back to 1992 when I first started writing C code.  All in one place.  Very helpful for newcomers who want to start a big project in C++, or for old-timers who want to have a nicer day of C++ coding.

ZeroTypes saves you the trouble of initializing types in the class constructor, provides useful insight into what you would need to, say, compare strings by using operator overloads, and implements two distinct pointer handlers (Zero-Pointer and Zero-Disposable-Pointer).

ZeroTypes was rigorously tested and combed through using cppCheck (http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) - one of the most useful tools on the planet for C++ developers.

Also included:

 - Super deep random numbers library
 - Random data generated from Atmospheric Data (Random.org), pseudorandoms and uniform() randoms
 - Extensive String manipulation functions
 - Kewl Beans BinaryFile class
 - Powerful optimized LinkedList class with MACROS for easy daily use
 - Super-simple JSON reader/writer
 - Awesome error code reading functions specifically for WinAPI
 - Nifty geometry helpers like distance and angle helpers for simple game AI
 - Utility functions galore

Examples
========

Before ZeroTypes:

```
class A {
 A() { x=0; }  // If you didn't do this, you would have problems
 int x;
};
```

After ZeroTypes:

```
class A {
 Zint x;
};
```

Much easier to write and read (humanly), yet it accomplishes the same thing.

Pointers before ZeroTypes:

```
class A {
 int *b;
 int *temp;
 A() { b=nullptr; temp=new int; }
 ~A() { delete temp; }
};
```

Pointers after ZeroTypes:

```
class A {
 Zpointer<int> b;
 Zdisposable<int> temp;
 A() {
  temp.Instantiate();
 }
 /* automatically destroys temp on destroy of A's instance but not b */
};
```

You can also write using ZeroTypes shorthand:

```
class A {
 Zp<int> b;
 Zdis<int> temp;
};
```

Strings before ZeroTypes:
```
class A {
 std::string alpha,beta;
 A() { alpha=string(""); beta=string("beta"); }
 bool Compares() { return ( alpha.compare(beta) == 0 ); }
};
```

Strings after ZeroTypes:

```
class A {
 Zstring alpha,beta;
 A() {}
 bool Compares() { return alpha == beta; }
};
```

No need for BOOST BLOAT!  DIY and DRY - Why use this over Boost or STL?

Well, it's lighter weight, specialized to only a handful of basic important types and their interoperability, and while powerful, Boost is bloat, and we are not bloat (sort-of).  Hey, you can use this WITH BOOST if you want.  No one is stopping you.

ZeroTypes implements the following Z-POD classes:

* Zint
* Zbyte
* Zuint
* Zdouble
* Zfloat
* Zbool
* Zstring

When should I use these?

In class descriptions almost always, as "properties" -- usually not as a parameter unless that is your prerogative.  You can also use them as globals.  

You generally want to use them in situations where data will be eventually converted to or from a string input.  I wrote them for use in OpenGL graphics applications, games and gaming servers (on Linux).  It is designed to assure you have initialized values, and optimizers will eliminate any "double initialization" woes you may feel you'll face.  You can type less, write more uniform implementations, and easily store and retrieve state from a string in memory or file - operations that are common in applications that require reading and writing files and states - or if you want to easily port your code with minimal syntax changes to Processing.org IDE or Javascript by simply removing the "Z" it will generally be similar to Java (Find/Replace to translate).  Also, I have sometimes converted PHP code quite easily back to C++ and visa versa using ZeroTypes snippets to help form my code, without losing performance and increasing application stability on the C++ side.

When should I cast these to their target data type?

When you are passing a Z-POD to a function that has multiple prototypes, for example std::abs() which takes a double, int or float, it is best to overcome interoperability overload features of the Z-POD by casting to enforce strict typing, or use their .value property to get at the wrapped POD.  A side effect of this necessary step is that you are certain, in situations where you are using ints and doubles together, for instance, that you are casting properly and getting the desired output data.  

```
// It's not always safe to assume one compiler to another,
// in a cross-platform or multi-platform context, will
// treat this:
 int x=50.5;
 double e=5.5*x;
// the way you think it should... did you mean 50.0 X 5.5 or 5 * 50 or 51 * 5.5 or ...
 int x=2;
 double f=1.0/x; // might be 0.5
 double g=1/x; // might be 0.0
```

This happens a lot when doing graphics applications as well as science applications.  So, the cast is useful not only to be explicit to the compiler, but also when you read it later you can double check your math against an "annotated" equation rather than a guessing game scenario.  It's also necessary when using printf() and other variable argument functions to be explicitly a POD type, so always cast your Zint and Zdouble to the desired format specifier (like %L or %f, which are sadly also platform specific).

There is also the matter of ambiguity, which is generally why I tend to avoid Zints and Zdoubles as function or method function parameters.  If I do end up using one as a last resort, I make sure to use a reference (unless a pointer is necessary), but rarely as a "copy" op, though it's not clear if that makes much of a difference.  When there is no ambiguity, the compiler will correctly find the right overload.

Example of type ambiguity as an artifact of using ZeroType POD-non-POD classes:

```
class Foo {
 Zint x;
 void absolute_value_Ex1() {
  return std::abs((double)x);
 }
 void absolute_value_Ex2() {
  return std::abs(x.value);
 }
 double absolute_value_Ex3_compiler_error_in_ambiguity() {
  return std::abs(x); 
  /* How would the compiler know which "x" you want due 
  to the interoperability features of Zint's cast overloading?
  If you're lucky, it will pick double, but you can't be too sure...
  The fix for this is in example Ex1. */
 }
 void my_abs(int i) { return std::abs(i); }
 int absolute_value_Ex4_works_fine_no_ambiguity() { return my_abs(x); }
};
```

Zpointer's .pointer caveat

Generally it's a good idea to use a Zpointer's .pointer if you absolutely need the pointer.  There are some edge cases where Zpointer's pointer to the wrapper class instance is accidentally substituted (at least in Visual Studio).  You'll know immediately if your code around there doesn't work. However, within itself, Zpointer works fine without the .pointer specificity.  The same can be said for Zdisposable.  One example of this is the ! operator is sometimes misconstrued.  My speculation is that when you have a Zpointer pointer pointer.  See below.

```
if ( !m->preview ) { /* I think this works most of the time in Visual Studio, but sometimes I get concerned. */ }
if ( m->preview.pointer != nullptr ) { /* this definitely works! */ }
```

ZeroTypes also comes with an optimized LinkedList base class and ListItem base class, and on top of these, there are helpers for sets of strings, which are folded into Zstring.

* ListItem (implements RTTI)
* LinkedList
* String : ListItem
* Strings : LinkedList

Include "Randoms.h" which implements a variety of different approaches, some original, some borrowed:

* RandomSet : ListItem
* RandomSets : LinkedList
* Random : LinkedList
* Randoms : LinkedList

Additionally, a lightweight template for handling one-or-two-dimensional arrays built to be fast, portable and extendable:
* ZIndexed

__To Do:__

Some of the code works on Linux. With a few changes, it will work on x64.  I'll get to this, or maybe you can by submitting a pull request on the github

* Make more Linux-friendly
* Make more Mac-friendly

You also get a slough of string helper functions, super useful macros collected since 1992, and a deep sense of resentment for casting.  All implemented for Microsoft Visual Studio's kinda wonky interpretation of C++.  Maybe one day I'll write documentation for all of this, but for now, my best advice is to read the code!
